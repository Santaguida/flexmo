Introduction

The problem

The test support sector is managed by several different tools,
many manual as printed forms and visual indicators, other
semi-automated tools such as spreadsheets and MS Office documents
and few automated by software as ICT ticket system. There is great
difficulty in having to historical reports of all the sector, thus
taking longer to detect problem causes for decision-making and
action.

The solution

Develop a unified automated system that enables a more dynamic and
consistent support service, providing tools such as reports,
historical maintenance and real-time monitoring of production and
problem causes, speeding a much faster and conscious action.
